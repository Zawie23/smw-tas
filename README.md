=======

**Download page**

Download the script(s) in the [release page](https://github.com/rodamaral/smw-tas/releases/latest).

**lsnes**

Verify your [lsnes version](http://tasvideos.org/Lsnes.html) and download the script accordingly.
The rr1 version is based on rr2, but with less features and less testing. Therefore, rr2 is more recommended and stable.
And lsnes-rr2 is way better.

**BizHawk**

ATTENTION: New script only works well for [BizHawk](http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory.html) 1.9.0 or higher.
The script is not as complete as lsnes and development is slower. However, the main features will be added.
The current TAS'ing features are pretty decent.
