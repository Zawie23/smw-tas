The main script is done to be run on the [lsnes](http://tasvideos.org/Lsnes.html) emulator, but there's partial support for [BizHawk](http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk.html) and [Snes9x](https://code.google.com/p/snes9x-rr/).

-------------
Users are recommended to download the script(s) in the [downloads' wiki page](https://github.com/rodamaral/smw-tas/wiki/Downloads), according to their emulator.

The latest release requires lsnes-rr2-Î²23++. This is the most complete script, with more features.

The functionality is better with maximized window, necessary to display text on the black lateral gaps.

Comparison script (experimental)
--------------------------------
In order to add the comparison script to the main utility, follow the instructions:

 1.  Open **lib/simple-ghost-player.lua** and edit the option *ghost_dumps*, putting the file location of each ghost, between the brackets. Separate each file with a comma. E.g.: `local ghost_dumps  = { "SMW-any%.smwg", "C:/Folder/simpleghost837244.smwg"}`
 2. To run and see the ghosts, you must run **smw-tas-lsnes.lua**, click on *Menu* > *Settings* and select *Load comparison ghost* and *Show*. It's better to enter the level after this operation.
 3. You can generate the *smwg* files with **lsnes-dumpghost.lua** or **snes9x-dumpghost.lua**. To do so, load the movie that you wanna dump (read-only mode), pause at the beginning and start the script. To finish it, stop the script. The *smwg* will in the same directory of the emulator or of the generator script, depending on the emulator.
