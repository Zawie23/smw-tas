**lsnes**

Verify your lsnes version and download the script accordingly. The rr1 version won't be updated like rr2, only eventual bug fixes are going to be done. Therefore, rr2 has more features and is more recommended.

**Bizhawk**

The script is not as complete as lsnes'. It also fails to draw correctly when the screen has lateral gaps (the black screen surrounding the game area). Therefore, use it without fullscreen. If you wanna use fullscreen, make sure to **not** maintain the aspect ratio of the image, so that there are no gaps around. To do so, you must go to *Config > Display* and unselect *Maintain aspect ratio*.
